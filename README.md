# Boxing Workout App ðŸ¥Š

Hey there! The Boxing Workout App is a little app born out of my struggle to quickly memorize combinations during training, this app has grown to be a companion for my shadowboxing sessions.

The app churns out random boxing combinations, manages your rounds, intervals, and rest periods.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Random Combination Generator:** Based on your selected difficulty level (simple, advanced, or both), the app dishes out random boxing combinations to challenge your memorization skills.
- **Random Mode:** It generates combinations for you to practice and execute quickly.
- **Additive Sets (Additive Mode):** Simulating a trainer calling out new moves, this mode starts with a basic combination and progressively adds new moves during a round.
- **Beep Indicators:** Audio cues signal the beginning and end of intervals and rest periods, along with the option to enable random action beeps for reflex training.
- **Interactive Controls:** Start, pause, reset or replay intervals effortlessly.
